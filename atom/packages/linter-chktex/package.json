  "readme": "# linter-chktex package\n\nThis Atom package provides a [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter) interface for the LaTeX `chktex` utility.  It provides real-time stylistic suggestions as you write.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install the Linter package. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).  \n2. Install `chktex` if it is not already installed.  `chktex` is installed by default with [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), but you may have to install it separately with other distributions.\n3. `apm install linter-chktex`\n4. If `chktex` is not in your PATH, you will need to set the `executablePath` to point to the directory containing `chktex`.\n\n## Settings\nYou can configure linter-chktex by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):\n```\n'linter-chktex':\n    executablePath: \"C:\\\\texlive\\\\2014\\\\bin\\\\win32\"\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute, please submit a pull request!\n",
